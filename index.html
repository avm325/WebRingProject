            Although small tasks may be “finished,” long term, “finishing” is just a concept that we humans try to embed in our heads to give ourselves a sense of accomplishment and pleasure.<br>
            <br> Finishing doesn’t exist.<br>
            <br>I don't even think ends exist.<br>
            <br>Nothing is ever finished.<br>
            <br> I’ve always struggled with these large, abstract thoughts, and yet I chase after the overwhelming, all-encompassing nature of life itself. All the things I don't understand, all the things I want to understand but can't.<br> 
            <br> Still, there is something to be said about the smallness of the world.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text2">
        <p>
        <br>I step outside, feeling the warmth of the sun and the crisp, coolness of the air. It’s late afternoon and the sun casts a wonderful yellow light on everything. This is my favorite time of day. The tree’s shadows form lovely latticed patterns on sidewalks, on grass, on asphalt, on earth. The breeze rustles thousands of leaves, tickling my ears and nose as it carries the scent of damp earth.<br>
        <br>When you pay really close attention to the things around you, observing for the sake of observation, you tend to forget about your troubles. Everything gets smaller. A mountain becomes a rock, a rock becomes a pebble, a pebble becomes a speck of dirt. Everything becomes simple.<br>
        </p>    
    </div>
    <div class="text3">
        <p>
            <br>Have you ever picked up a stone and really looked at it? It’s phenomenal. There are so many colors you would have never seen, its texture has such nuance if your finger explores it carefully. Have you ever looked at a pile of sand? Those little bits of coral and shell could tell you every secret of the world.
        </p>    
    </div>
    <div class="text4">
        <p>
            As I walk, the clouds start to take on the color of the evening, becoming almost luminescent as they reflect warm light onto everything. I’ve always loved how the silhouette of a tree is similar to the silhouette of a cloud. 
            <br><br>Golden light slants between leafy branches and illuminates the tall roadside grass. At the right angle, the light grazes the blades and their flowers and gives them a delicate bright lining. If you bend down and look closely at that maze of grass, you’ll see its flowers, and those flowers become several florets that before appeared as one. 
        </p>

    <div class="text5">
        <p>
            When you are noticing these small things, your mind starts to contemplate even smaller things. The repetitious composition of it all. A tree becomes its branches, and its branches become leaves and the leaves become the thin veins that branch further. Perhaps even smaller things, like the cells that compose those veins, the organelles that compose those cells, and the atoms that compose those organelles. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text6">
        <p>
            Sometimes when you are noticing small things you start to contemplate very, very big things. Like origin. Like God. Like omnipresence. Like Creation. Like everything I don't understand. I can accept things like this to be out of my control, sometimes even out of my mind’s grasp. In that sense they actually become really simple. <br><br>They actually become small. 

            <br> <br><br>It's interesting the way that things get smaller, evanescent, fading into nothing as we fade into what surrounds us.
